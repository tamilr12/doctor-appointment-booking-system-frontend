üèóÔ∏è**Microservices Architecture**

Microservices is an architectural style where an application is divided into small, independent services. Each service handles a specific business function and communicates with others via APIs.


‚úÖ**Key Characteristics of Microservices**




Independently Deployable: Services can be deployed, updated, or scaled independently.
Loosely Coupled: Each service operates independently with minimal dependencies.
Technology Agnostic: Each service can use different languages, databases, or frameworks.
Domain-Driven: Each service is built around a specific business domain (e.g., user, appointment).



Why Microservices for a Doctor Appointment Booking System?




A doctor appointment system needs to handle diverse functionalities such as:
User registration/login
Booking and rescheduling appointments
Notifications and reminders
Feedback and ratings
Doctor availability management



In a monolithic architecture, all this logic would live in one codebase, making it:



‚ùå Hard to maintain
‚ùå Risky to update (one bug can crash the whole app)
‚ùå Difficult to scale specific features


With microservices, each feature is:



‚úîÔ∏è Built independently
‚úîÔ∏è Scaled as needed
‚úîÔ∏è Deployed without affecting others

Microservices in the Doctor Appointment Booking System



| Microservice             | Responsibility                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **User Service**         | Signup, login, profile management             |
| **Appointment Service**  | Booking, canceling, rescheduling appointments |
| **Doctor Service**       | Doctor registration, availability, schedules  |
| **Feedback Service**     | Patient feedback and doctor ratings           |
| **Auth Service**         | JWT/session-based authentication              |
| **API Gateway**          | Routes requests to appropriate services       |

üîÅ**SOLID Principles Applied**
We follow the SOLID design principles to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability in our Doctor Appointment Booking System.

**S ‚Äì Single Responsibility Principle**
Each module or class handles a single responsibility.

 AppointmentService is solely responsible for appointment-related operations.

**O ‚Äì Open/Closed Principle**
The system is designed to be open for extension but closed for modification.

You can add new appointment features like recurring appointments or payment integration without changing existing appointment booking logic.

**L ‚Äì Liskov Substitution Principl**e
Subclasses or implementations can replace their parent types without altering the system behavior.

 DoctorUser and PatientUser can replace a base User class wherever it's expected.

**I ‚Äì Interface Segregation Principle**
Interfaces are tailored to specific needs to prevent bloated designs.

IBookAppointment and IManageSchedule interfaces ensure that each user type (doctor/patient) only implements the relevant operations.

**D ‚Äì Dependency Inversion Principle**
High-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

 Controllers use IAppointmentRepository interfaces instead of being tightly coupled to specific databases like MongoAppointmentRepo.
